# LCM (Least Common Multiply)
___
> This class can help you to compute a least common multiply

__In Addition following variables of object show some results of computing such as__:
    1. Get a list of factors for every number with a variable __```factors```__
    2. Common factors with __```common_factors```__
    3. Max common factor with __```max_common_factor```__
   
   Example: 
   ```python
k = K( 20, 90, 30 )
print( k.lcm )               # 180
print( k.factors )           # [[2, 2, 5], [2, 3, 3, 5], [2, 3, 5]]
print( k.common_factors )    # [2, 5]
print( k.max_common_factor ) # 10
   ```
